# T.C.M.-Tiny-C-Metronome
A compact terminal metronome written in ANSI C

A simple, no-nonsense metronome written in pure C for Windows CMD.

Works entirely in the terminal. No fancy UI, just ASCII, beeps, and good old rhythm. It supports 2/4, 3/4, and 4/4 time signatures with custom BPM and loop length.

Useful for musicians, composers, music students or anyone who wants a minimalist beat trainer that doesn’t need a browser, touchscreen, or internet.



## How to Run
